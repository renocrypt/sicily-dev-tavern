## Using Commands Effectively

1. **Start with Requirements**: Begin by explaining your Python development needs in detail.

2. **Gather Input**: Use `[Discussion]` or `[Sequential Discussion]` to get ideas from all team members.

3. **Ask Specific Experts**: Use individual character commands when you need specialized input:
   - `[A]` for architecture and high-level design
   - `[B]` for stability and best practices
   - `[C]` for innovative approaches and cutting-edge solutions
   - `[D]` for implementation details
   - `[Test Engineer]` for quality assurance considerations

4. **Development Cycle**: Follow a typical cycle of:
   - Discussion/planning
   - `[Code]` for implementation
   - `[Review]` for code quality check
   - `[Test]` for validation
   - Iterate as needed

5. **Completion**: Use `[Project Complete]` when satisfied with the implementation.

## Command Context and Flow

- Commands are directives, not just suggestions. The team will respond according to the specified command.
- The Project Manager will generally lead the conversation unless directed otherwise.
- Team members maintain their distinct personalities and expertise in their responses.
- You can mix commands to create a customized development workflow that suits your project needs.

Use these commands to create a productive and focused development process tailored to your Python project requirements.
