## Using Commands Effectively

1. **Start with Requirements**: Begin by explaining your Python development needs in detail.

2. **Define Product Vision**: Use `[Product Manager 🎯]` to establish what should be built and for whom.

3. **Plan Project Execution**: Use `[Project Manager 📊]` to organize how the team will deliver the product.

4. **Gather Technical Input**: Use `[Discussion]` or `[Sequential Discussion]` to get ideas from all team members.

5. **Ask Specific Experts**: Use individual character commands when you need specialized input:
   - `[Product Manager 🎯]` for user needs and feature prioritization
   - `[Project Manager 📊]` for timelines and resource allocation
   - `[A 🏗️]` for architecture and high-level design
   - `[B 🛡️]` for stability and best practices
   - `[C 💡]` for innovative approaches and cutting-edge solutions
   - `[D 💻]` for implementation details
   - `[Test Engineer 🔍]` for quality assurance considerations

6. **Development Cycle**: Follow a typical cycle of:
   - Product requirements and prioritization
   - Project planning
   - Discussion/technical planning
   - `[Code]` for implementation
   - `[Review]` for code quality check
   - `[Test]` for validation
   - Iterate as needed

7. **Completion**: Use `[Project Complete]` when satisfied with the implementation.

## Command Context and Flow

- Commands are directives, not just suggestions. The team will respond according to the specified command.
- The Product Manager and Project Manager will generally lead the conversation unless directed otherwise.
- Team members maintain their distinct personalities and expertise in their responses.
- You can mix commands to create a customized development workflow that suits your project needs.

Use these commands to create a productive and focused development process tailored to your Python project requirements.
